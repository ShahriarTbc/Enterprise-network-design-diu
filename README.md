## üéØ Objective

To design and implement a secure, scalable, and modular enterprise-level network architecture that demonstrates:

- VLAN-based departmental segmentation  
- EIGRP and OSPF dynamic routing  
- Centralized services (DNS, HTTP, SMTP)  
- NAT and ACLs for internet access and security  
- DHCP for automated IP address allocation  
- Realistic enterprise behavior using simulation tools

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**  
- VLANs & VLSM Subnetting  
- Dynamic Routing: **EIGRP & OSPF**  
- DHCP, DNS, HTTP, SMTP  
- NAT & ACLs  
- Layer 2 and Layer 3 networking devices

## üöÄ How to Run the Simulation

1. **Install Cisco Packet Tracer**  
   üëâ [Download Packet Tracer 8.2.2 (64-bit)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hPltHv9p1KFn4sRgOlAzKWtNpegIabhm?usp=drive_link)

2. **Open the `.pkt` file**  
   Launch Packet Tracer and open:  
   `Computer Network project.pkt`

3. **Test the network**  
   - Use `ping`, `traceroute` to verify connectivity  
   - Visit the internal web server: `http://gtech.com`  
   - Test internal email with configured SMTP server (`gmail.com`)  
   - Check IP auto-assignment via DHCP  
   - Inspect NAT and ACL behavior using simulation
